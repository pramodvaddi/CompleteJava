    // Data Structures
        // 1. Primitive Data Structure
        // 2. Non - Primitive Data Structure
        // 3. Linear Data Structure
        // 4. Non - Linear Data Structure
        // 5. Static Data Structure
        // 6. Non - Static Data Structure
        // 7. Static Data Structure
        // 8. Dynamic Data Structure

    // When you create 4 variables to store some data, these variables will be allocated in different places with different addresses inside memory. This will not satisfy the Data structure as there is not relation between two variables allocated indside memory.
    // In an Array, we can store data in sequential manner, thus the relation can happen between the data satisfying Data structure concept.
    // But in an Array, we pre define the size of it. int a[] = new int[5];
    // Node: Instead of using the word space, we can use node. Node is an another word of space.
    // Note: In Java, memory allocation is done during run time.

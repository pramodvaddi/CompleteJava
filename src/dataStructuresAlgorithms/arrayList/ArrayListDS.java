    /*
        ArrayList is a dynamic array of Objects. We have to use wrapper classes here as we cannot create objects for Primitive data types.

        Difference between Array and ArrayList
        1. Arrays are natural data structures whereas ArrayList is an added class.
        2. Arrays are of fixed size whereas ArrayList can grow and shrink.
        3. Arrays can hold primitive data types whereas ArrayList can only hold objects.

        Creating an ArrayList: The object must be specified using <> when creating ArrayList.
            Ex: ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
                List<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();

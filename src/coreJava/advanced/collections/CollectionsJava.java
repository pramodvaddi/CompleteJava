        Collections: Collections is a framework provided by Java.
        This framework provides many interfaces and their implemented classes in order to store group of objects(elements) in a single entity.

        Interfaces provided by Collections framework.

        Collections Framework comes with two interfaces, Collection and Map
              1. Collection <interface>
                    List<interface> implements
                        - ArrayList
                        - LinkedList
                        - Vector
                        - Stack

                    Set<interface> implements
                        - HashSet
                        - LinkedHashSet
                        - TreeSet

                    Queue<interface> implements
                        - ArrayQueue
                        - PriorityQueue

              2. Map <interface> implements
                       - HashTable
                       - HashMap
                       - LinkedHashMap
                       - TreeMap

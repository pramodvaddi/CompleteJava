        Polymorphism(Multiple Forms): An ability of an object to take many forms.
        First program will compile and then executed.
        Two types of Polymorphism
            1. Compile-time Polymorphism: Achieved during compilation time.
                    Also known as Static Polymorphism (Fixed) or Early binding.
                    To achieve this, we use Method Overloading.

            2. Runtime Polymorphism: Achieved at Java runtime or execution time.
                    Also known as Dynamic Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch.
                    To achieve this, we use Method Overriding.

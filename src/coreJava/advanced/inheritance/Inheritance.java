    /*
        Inheritance: A mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviours of another class
        with a specific relationship.

       1. To introduce code reusability, we use Inheritance
       2. Parent class is know as Super class.
       3. Child class is known as subclass.

       4. In Java, Multiple inheritance is not supported. To overcome this, we have interface.
       5. Super Keyword: If you have a method in super class which is inherited from subclass and you created a method with same
       name in super class, this will point to the method which is in subclass. To overcome this, meaning if you want to use the method which is in super class,
       use super keyword.

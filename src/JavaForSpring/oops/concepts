Difference between Object Oriented and Object Based
    Java is a Object Oriented language as we use inheritance to access the members of other class. This is not possible in Object based programming language. VB (Visual Basic) is an Object based.


Java is not 100% Object Oriented Programming language as it supports primitive data types and static key word.
To make Java 100% OOP language, we use wrapper classes.


Simula is the first Object Oriented Programming Language
SmallTalk is the first 100% OOP language.

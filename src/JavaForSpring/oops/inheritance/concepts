Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the data and methods of another class by specific relationship.

Inheritance is used for code re-usability.

Parent class is referred to Super class, whilst, Child class is referred as Sub Class.

class Developer extends Guest {

    The class to the right side of guest is Super/Parent class
    The class to the left side of guest is Sub/Child class

}

Multiple inheritance is only possible with Interfaces.

In Interface, we wont be having any implementation for the methods.

In Interface, we can extends multiple classes and interfaces.


Super keyword is used to call parent class properties in child class.
